How to choose ML Algorithm?

usecase - supervised machine learning problem case and we have a dataset like 1.Regression  or 2.classification

1.Regression type dataset which output or target is numerical in this case we use linear regression machine learning algorithm

2.Classification type dataset which output or target is categorical in this case we use machine learning algorithm like
a.logistic regression
b.decesion tree
c.random forest
d.xgboost
e.KNN(K nearest neighbour)

# techniques
At 1st go for the visualization ,draw a pairplot by using seaborn library then you can make decesion

1. for linear dataset we use logistic regression and for non linear dataset we use decesion tree,random forest,xgboost,KNN(K nearest neighbour).

2. We always trying to use logistic regression because it is require less time to execute as compare to others so when we have millions and millions data it will be helpful.

3. if the datas are too much overlapping then we use KNN because in KNN there is a concept of euclidean distance to find out the similarity of points where it belongs to.

4. Otherwise we can use decesion tree,random forest,xgboost.
